# SnowRunner - Save Editor.

It is GUI desktop application for edit SnowRunner save file (PC only).
For now it supports only editing CompleteSave.cfg.

The main goal of application is editing exist save. 
For example your save was lost. You are create new one. And with this application edit your new created save file untill it looks like the old save file.

There are few functions:
Edit money count, rank and expiriece.
Edit list of complete tasks. 
Edit list of founded upgrades.

All other things you can buy with created money.

The app developed with C++, Qt, RapidJSON, RapidXML and ton of crutches.
It tested by me under Linux and Windows platforms with PC game version save files.

Always backup your save directory before editing save file. For example if the structure of save file will be changed this app can broke it. If one day your save will be broken with this app it's not my problem. Use on your own risks!

There are issues. For now tasks marked as completed isn't counted in statistics. Trucks upgrades too. I will fix it soon.
 
Free to use/edit/fork.
